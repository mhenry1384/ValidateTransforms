# ValidateTransforms
Generates transforms for all the configs in a solution to verify transforms work.  This is intended to be used so that you can catch bad transforms during a build instead of during an Octopus deploy

Use the -SaveInCurrentDir to save the transforms to the current directory instead of the temp folder
